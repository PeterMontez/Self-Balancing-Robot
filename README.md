# Self Balancing Robot

A two wheeled arduino robot that balances itself using live data from a gyroscope.


## About the project

Using an Arduino Uno and a gyro/accel sensor, the robot uses a feedback loop to mantain itself balanced upright and even move, responding to commands given through Bluetooth communication.

The project uses a 5v power bank as it's power source, and a XL6009 voltage boster to power two 12v arduino motors with the aid of a L298N H-bridge module.


## Where are we

- Getting data from the gyro/accel
- Setting up the circuit
- Designing the robot to be laser cut from MDF
